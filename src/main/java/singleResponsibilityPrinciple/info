SRP: Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change
means a class should have only one responsibility

For Exp:

We have Marker class
We have Invoice class
    we are calculating invoice price
    we are printing invoice
    we are saving data to DB

Now does this class Invoice follow SRP? No
Because it has more than one reason to make change in class Invoice
reason_1: changing calculating price logic (GST including)
reason_2: change in printing method
reason_3: change in saving method(file)

all above reasons leads to change the class


Correct : try to make class that will have only one reason to get changed

we made three class:
1 Invoice => to calculate invoice price
2 InvoiceDao(data access layer to store in db) => to save data in DB/file
3 InvoicePrinter => to print invoice

Now each class has only one reason to change
