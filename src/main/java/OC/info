OC: Open For Extension but Closed for Modification

Here InvoiceDao class is already tested an deployed
Say I got new requirement to save in file also
So what I did I wrote saveToFile() method to save into file

Is this following OC Principle? No
Because we are adding to already tested file and it is prone to bug

Correct:

We have created interface of InvoiceDao
and two class
DatabaseInvoiceDao => implement save method of interface InvoiceDao
FileInvoiceDao => implement save method of interface InvoiceDao

And if in future we need some other method to save we just create new class and implement save method of interface InvoiceDao
